#Include a chart. Make sure to describe why you included the chart, and what patterns emerged

#The second chart that you will create and include will show how two different (continuous) variables are 
#related to one another. Again, think carefully about what such a comparison means and what you want to 
#communicate to your user (you may have to find relevant trends in the dataset first!). Here are some 
#requirements to help guide your design:
  
# - You must have clear x and y axis labels
#- The chart needs a clear titleÂ 
#- If you choose to add a color encoding (not required), you need a legend for your different color and a clear legend title
