#The first chart that you will create and include will show the trend over time of your variable/topic. 
#Think carefully about what you want to communicate to your user 
#(you may have to find relevant trends in the dataset first!). 
#Here are some requirements to help guide your design:
  
#-Show more than one, but fewer than ~10 trends
#-This may mean showing the same measure for different locations or different racial groups. 
# Think carefully about a meaningful comparison of locations (e.g., the top 10 counties in a state, top 10 states, etc.)
#- You must have clear x and y axis labels
#- The chart needs a clear titleÂ 
#- You need a legend for your different line colors and a clear legend title

#When we say "clear" or "human readable" titles and labels, that means that you should not just display the variable name.
